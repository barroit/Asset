# Lines starting with # is comment.
# The first column specifies the config file that needs to be placed.
# The second column specifies the location where the config file is to be
# placed, and there are two scenarios:
#  1 Path ending with '/' indicates that the config file will be placed in that
#    directory.
#  2 Path not ending with '/' indicates that the config file will be placed at
#    that path. This is useful when the actual name of the config file differs
#    from the last segment of the path.
# The third column indicates whether the configuration file needs to be parsed.
